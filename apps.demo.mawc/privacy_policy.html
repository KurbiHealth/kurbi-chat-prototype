<p style="text-align: center">Notice of Privacy Practices</p>
<p align="center"><strong>THIS NOTICE DESCRIBES HOW MEDICAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOU MAY BE USED AND DISCLOSED AND HOW YOU CAN GET ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION.</strong></p>
<div>
<p align="center"><strong>PLEASE REVIEW IT CAREFULLY.</strong></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>KURBI LLC AND ASSOCIATED HEALTH CARE PRACTITIONERS HAS A LEGAL DUTY TO SAFEGUARD YOUR PROTECTED HEALTH</strong> <strong>INFORMATION.&nbsp; </strong>All employees, volunteers, staff, doctors, health professionals and other personnel are legally required to and must abide by the policies set forth in this notice, and to protect the privacy of your health information.</p>
<p><strong>This “protected health information,” or PHI for short, includes information that can be used to identify you.&nbsp; We collect or receive this information about your past, present or future health condition to provide health care to you, or to receive payment for this health care.</strong>&nbsp; We must provide you with this notice about our privacy practices that explains how, when and why we use and disclose your PHI.&nbsp; We will follow the terms of our current notice.&nbsp; With some exceptions, we may not use or disclose any more of your PHI than is necessary to accomplish the need for the information.&nbsp; We also are required to notify you following a breach of your unsecured PHI.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to change the terms of this notice and our privacy policies at any time.&nbsp; Any changes to this notice will apply to the PHI already in existence.&nbsp; Before we make any change to our policies, we will promptly change this notice and post a new notice in our lobby.&nbsp; You can also request a copy of this notice from the contact person listed at the end of this notice at any time and can view a copy of the notice on our Web site at www.gokurbi.com.</p>
<div>
<p><strong>WE MAY USE AND DISCLOSE YOUR PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION</strong> for many different reasons.&nbsp; For some of these reasons, we will need your permission or a specific, signed authorization.&nbsp; Below, we describe the different categories of when we use and release your PHI and give you some examples of each category.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>A. WE MAY USE, OR DISCLOSE YOUR PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION FOR TREATMENT, PAYMENT, OR HEALTH CARE OPERATIONS.</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. For treatment.</strong>&nbsp; We may disclose your PHI to physicians, nurses, medical students, and other health care personnel and agencies who provide or are involved in your health care.&nbsp; For example, if you are being treated for a knee injury, we may disclose your PHI to the physical rehabilitation department in order to coordinate your care.&nbsp; In some cases the sharing of your PHI with other healthcare providers may be done electronically, including through an electronic health information exchange.</p>
<p><strong>2.&nbsp; To obtain payment for treatment.</strong>&nbsp; We may use and disclose your PHI in order to bill and collect payment for services provided to you.&nbsp; It is important that you provide us with correct and up-to-date PHI.&nbsp; For example, we may disclose portions of your PHI to our billing department and your health plan to get paid for the health care services we provided to you.&nbsp; We may also disclose your PHI to our business associates, such as billing companies, claims processing companies and others that process our health care claims.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong>&nbsp; <strong>To operate our health care business. </strong>&nbsp;We may disclose your PHI in order to operate our facility in compliance with healthcare regulations.&nbsp; For example, we may use your PHI to review the quality of our services and to evaluate the performance of our staff in caring for you.</p>
<p><strong>B.&nbsp; WE ALSO DO NOT REQUIRE YOUR CONSENT TO USE OR DISCLOSE YOUR PHI:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.&nbsp; When requested by federal, state, or local law; judicial or administrative proceedings; or law enforcement agencies.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; We will disclose your PHI when a law requires that we report information to government agencies and law enforcement personnel, for example, about victims of abuse, neglect, or domestic violence; when dealing with gunshot and other wounds; or when ordered in a judicial or administrative proceeding.&nbsp; We may also disclose your PHI in response to a subpoena, discovery request, or other lawful process, but only if efforts have been made to notify you and give you an opportunity to object to the request, or to obtain a protective order for the PHI.</p>
<p><strong>2.&nbsp; For public health activities.&nbsp; </strong>We report information about births, deaths, and various diseases to government officials in charge of collecting that information and we provide coroners, medical examiners and funeral directors necessary information relating to an individual’s death.</p>
<p><strong>3.&nbsp; For purposes of organ donation.</strong>&nbsp; For patients that have previously agreed to organ donation, we may notify organ procurement organizations to assist them in organ, eye or tissue donation and transplants.</p>
<p><strong>4.&nbsp; To avoid harm.</strong>&nbsp; In order to avoid a serious threat to health or safety of a person or the public, we may provide your demographic PHI to law enforcement personnel or persons able to prevent or lessen such harm.</p>
<p><strong>5.&nbsp; For worker’s compensation purposes.&nbsp; </strong>We may disclose your PHI in order to comply with worker’s compensation laws.&nbsp; If you do not want worker’s compensation notified, alternate insurance or payment information must be supplied.</p>
<p><strong>6.</strong>&nbsp; <strong>For appointment reminders and health-related benefits and</strong> <strong>services.</strong>&nbsp; We may use your demographic PHI to contact you as a reminder that you have an appointment or to recommend possible treatment options or alternatives that may be of interest to you.</p>
<p><strong>7.&nbsp; For fundraising activities.</strong>&nbsp; We may use your PHI to communicate with you to raise funds for our healthcare system.&nbsp; We may disclose your PHI to a foundation related to KURBI LLC so that the foundation may contact you to raise money for us.&nbsp; The money raised through these activities is used to expand and support the health care services and educational programs we provide to the community.&nbsp; In these cases, we would use or disclose only your name, address and phone number, age, gender, and the dates and departments of service.&nbsp; If you do not wish to be contacted as part of our fundraising efforts, please contact the person listed at the end of this notice.</p>
<p><strong>8.&nbsp; For Communications About Programs or Products. </strong>Most uses and disclosures of PHI for marketing purposes will be made only with your written authorization.&nbsp; We may use PHI to communicate to you about a product or service if the communication occurs face-to-face, involves a gift of nominal value, or is for a drug refill.&nbsp; We may use and disclose your PHI to communicate with you about a heal-related product or service we offer.&nbsp; In addition, we may use or disclose your PHI to tell you about products or services related to your treatment, case management or care coordination, or alternative treatments, therapies, providers or settings of care for you.</p>
<p><strong>9.&nbsp; For Health Oversight Activities.&nbsp; </strong>We may disclose your PHI to a health oversight agency for activities authorized by law.&nbsp; These oversight activities may include audits, investigations, and inspections.&nbsp; These activities are necessary for the government to monitor the health care system, government benefit programs, and compliance with civil rights laws.</p>
<p><strong>10. For Research.</strong>&nbsp; Under certain circumstances, we may use and disclose PHI about you for research purposes.&nbsp; All research projects are subject to a special approval process and information disclosed is only done so with you consent or with appropriate authority as permitted by law.</p>

<p><strong>13. For Inmates.</strong>&nbsp; We may disclose your PHI to correctional institutions or law enforcement officials if you are an inmate or under the custody of a law enforcement official.&nbsp; Disclosure for these purposes would be necessary:&nbsp; (a) for the institution to provide health care services to you, (b) for the safety and security of the institution, and/or (c) to protect your health and safety or the health and safety of other individuals.</p>
